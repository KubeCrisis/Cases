Misconfigured Wordpress deployment at k8s single-node cluster with poorly optimized add-ons. DB config shoud be inefficient. Jmeter simulates high load for Wordpress service (another vm, configs should be at general-configs).

Task:
- Identify issue and misconfigurations in Wordpress. 
- Correct deployment for Wordpress.
- Bonus track: implement prometheus and alerts.
